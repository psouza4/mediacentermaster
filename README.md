## Issue Tracker Rules:
  * All bug report issues must be discussed at the [community forums](http://forums.MediaCenterMaster.com/) first for verification.  If an issue is confirmed, it should be posted here as a Bug Report or Source Change depending the type of issue.
  * Feature requests do not need to must be approved at the [community forums](http://forums.MediaCenterMaster.com/) (but we encourage you to do so anyway), however please make sure your request isn't covered by an existing request first.  Search through all issues, in case we've dismissed that request before for whatever reason.
  * If you have questions or need support, please stop by our [forums](http://forums.MediaCenterMaster.com).  Neither the Issue Tracker, nor Facebook or Twitter, are good means for providing support.
